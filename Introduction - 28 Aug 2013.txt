Machine Learning -- 28 Aug 2013
-----------------------------------

Supervised Learning:
	Given an observation X, what is the best label y?
	Features vs Predictors (ML vs Stats)
	P(y|X)

Unsupervised Learning:
	"generative"
	P(X)

Semi-supervised Learning:
	Lots of unlabeled data, some labels

Reinforcement Learning:
	For X, this is or is not the correct label
	"you never know the consequences of the actions you didn't take"


Y = f(x)
Y could be a real number (regression) 


Generally rows are observations

Netflix problem:
	people are rows, columns are their rankings for movies
	for non-numeric labels, do repeated regressions on each label to determine which it belongs to

errors, norms, loss functions
	L2 norm = euclidean distance
	L0 norm = yes or no

For every function, what is it optimizing? What's your loss function?

Machine learning vs. Statistics
	much overlap- regression, probability, HMMs
